Blackjack Game
This will be a simple console game of blackjack, with a couple vectors controlling which cards are in the deck and which ones have been drawn already, as well as a couple vectors for the player and dealer. The dealer will always stop on 18.
You will be able to see all of your cards and only one of the dealer's cards.
